# Formal Automata

## ALPHABET -

An alphabet is a finite non empty set of symbols.
Here in toc, we use symbol ∑ for depicting alphabet. e.g. ∑ = {0,1}.
For English ∑ = {a, b, c, ...z}

## STRING -

It is a finite sequence of symbols
(which are the member of set alphabet).
E.g. i = {a, b} String- aabb, aa, b, so on.
(in English we called them as words).

## LANGUAGE -

A language is defined as a set of strings.
In the next level we consider programs as a string and programming
constructs/tokens like int, floats as letters/symbols.
